Experienced SQL Server DBA who loves making things simpler. Favourite pets are knowledge bases and run-books (SharePoint, OneNote, any other place that can be used to make the team’s life easier). Big appetite for data – scrape them (R/Python), store them (SQL), analyse them (Power BI/Excel).
Not afraid of challenges – the journey to find a solution is very exciting.
