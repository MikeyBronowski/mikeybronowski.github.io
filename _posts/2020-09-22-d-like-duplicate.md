![D like Duplicate](/assets/images/2020-09-22-d-like-duplicate_01.png)

I found the CTRL+D shortcut key as an interesting feature in many programs. It can duplicate without using copy and paste. But not always. It is also D like DELETE, DISPLAY, or HIGHLIGHT…

# Microsoft Office Excel and Google Docs Spreadsheets.

In Excel or Google Spreadsheet, CTRL +D duplicates content from the cell/cells row above. We need to highlight cells under our data and use CTRL+D.

Also, we can duplicate data in as many cells as we want. Choose cells from one row from one, two, or more columns and mark empty cells under, use CTRL+D and they will be filled in with our data.

# Microsoft Office PowerPoint.

Simple CTRL+D – duplicate your slide or slides if we marked it right-click. Also using these shortcuts you can duplicate objects eg. photo, background.

# Power Bi – Dax Query Editor.

In our query editor, we highlight a word and If we use CTRL+D it shows us the duplicate word, and how many times we use this short cut it shows us this word in our code. It is not a copy-paste trick but using this we can change words in our query if we eg. change the name of the table.

DAX – highlight the word.

DAX – highlight the word +CTRL+D.

DAX – possibility to change words.

# Duplicate with SHIFT.

In  WordPress, we use CTRL+SHIFT+D – it means that the line above will be duplicated.

Why SHIFT? Because in the browser CTRL+D is a shortcut key for adding your page to a favorite.

# Not always DUPLICATE!

In **Microsoft Office Power Pivot** (add-inn for Excel) we use CTRL+D like DELETE. We can delete our table.

In **Windows**, if we marked a file or document using  CTRL+D we can remove it to the Recycle Bin.

**SQL Server Management Studio**. In SSMS we can have our query results in the grid or in the text. It means if we use CTRL+T and then execute our query we got the data in text format, and if we use CTRL+D we will get back to a grid.

SSMS -CTRL+T

SSMS -CTRL+D

In **Microsoft Office Word doc** we can use  CTRL+D and it will display font dialog – but CTRL+F will do the same.

That shortcut key seems to be very handy as a replacement of copy and paste or delete some things.

Thank you, Magda
