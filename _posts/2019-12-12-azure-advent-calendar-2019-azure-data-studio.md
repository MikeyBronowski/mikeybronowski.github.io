Earlier this month I had a pleasure to attend the third edition of Data:Scotland - the data platform conference that takes place in Glasgow, Scotland. In this place I would like to thank you, everyone, who helped me to make this happen:

* My family always supports me. Love you!
* The Dream team behind the Data:Scotland: [Craig](https://twitter.com/CPorteous) / [Louise](https://twitter.com/patersonlouise) / [Robert](https://twitter.com/sql_bob) / [Paul](https://twitter.com/pauby). You gave me the opportunity to be an active part of the event. Thank you!
* My mentor [Rob](https://twitter.com/sqldbawithbeard) who gave me tips and helped me to understand what all that speaking is about :-) Thanks, Mr. Beard!
* [Alex](https://twitter.com/arcticdba) and [Mark](https://twitter.com/MarkPM_MSFT) for sharing their experience with new speakers during dedicated online sessions. Both sessions were great. I have learned from Alex what to do, and from Mark what NOT to. Tack!!!
* My TEAM at work, especially [Dan](https://twitter.com/LeedsDBA) who always encourages us to share what we know. Cheers Boss! Cheers TEAM!

 The list could go on and on, but I will end with probably the biggest group - all of you SQL Family / Data Family community members. It all started with [Data Community Poland](https://twitter.com/DataCommunityPL) (Katowice then Kraków) and continues with [Leeds Data Platform](https://twitter.com/dataleeds).

Thank you,
Mikey
