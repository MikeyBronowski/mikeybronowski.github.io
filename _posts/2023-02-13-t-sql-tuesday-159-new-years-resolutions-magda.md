If you want to read about my favourite new feature in SQL Server 2022 [read this post](2023-02-14-t-sql-tuesday-159-favourite-sql-server-2022-feature-magda).

##  New Resolutions
I thought I can write another post about the second Deepthi Goguri's  topic about the New year, New Resolutions.

I usually did not have any resolutions, because when I would like to do something I just do it, spontaneously, without planning, or crossing days in the calendar. If this was a success - that's cool if I failed, wiped tears, and have no regrets because my year has not been ruined. I found this fair for myself.

But I have a few resolutions, a few things that I would like to do in the next months. 

## Microsoft Certifications
I would like to find time to learn and pass the exam for MS certifications, I am thinking of 2 exams - but will see.

## Workout Wednesday
The second is quite fresh because I found this workout last week and I would like to give it a try. This would be a weekly workout about PowerBi, and this can be found here: https://workout-wednesday.com/. I need to catch up on a few lessons from the beginning of the year, but I hope I will be up to date soon with all this year's lessons, and there will be another 48 to go.

Thanks,

Magda
