This blog post is part of the [Festive Tech Calendar](https://festivetechcalendar.com/).

If you want to practice the whole thing I have prepared an interactive notebook for you that could be opened with Azure Data Studio for example ([link to the notebook](https://github.com/MikeyBronowski/Presentations/tree/main/2020/FestiveTechCalendar)). For more things about the PowerShell module check [this post](https://www.bronowski.it/blog/2020/12/how-to-excel-with-powershell-importexcel/) out.

I would like to invite you to the world of magic!
